\begin{itemize}
\item description of current software commissioning practices
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Script, IaC, Provisioning: ansible, puppet, chef, salt,
    terraform, Docker etc.
  \item Orchestration out of the scope (K8s, Swarm, TOSCA etc.)
  \end{itemize}
\item interesting properties regarding soft. commissioning
  \begin{itemize}
  \item good software engineering properties in soft. commissioning
    (composition, reuse, maintainability, separation of concerns etc.)
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Ansible, Puppet, Chef ok but limited
    \item component-based approach ok but less flexible
    \end{itemize}
  \item programmable / flexibility
    \begin{itemize}
    \item customized commissioning tasks or operations
    \item Ansible, Puppet, Chef ok
    \item component-based approach not ok and ok (?)
    \end{itemize}
  \item parallelism / efficiency which is directly related to
    dependencies than can be defined between elements and tasks and
    which is also related to the previous flexibility property
    \begin{itemize}
    \item SPMD (find another name) STMH (same tasks on multiple
      hosts): puppet, ansible, deployware (?) etc.
    \item dependencies between different components (MariaDB then
      Apache): Puppet, ansible, deployware etc.
    \item dependencies between tasks of components: aeolus, puppet (?)
    \item dependencies between tasks of a single component: hand
      written except for Madeus and Puppet (?) but not used by Puppet
      for parallelism
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
