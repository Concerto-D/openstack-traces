%This paper focuses on one specific challenge related to distributed
%software deployment: \emph{distributed software commissioning}. By
%software commissioning we mean the complete installation,
%configuration and testing process when deploying distributed software
%on physical distributed resources, with or without a virtualization
%layer in between. This process is complex and error-prone because of
%the specificity of the installation process according to the operating
%system, the different kinds of virtualization layers used between the
%physical machines and the pieces of software, the amount of possible
%configuration options~\cite{Xu:2015:SAT:2775083.2791577}. Recently,
%commissioning (or configuration) management tools such as
%Ansible\footnote{\url{https://www.ansible.com/}}, or
%Puppet\footnote{\url{https://puppet.com}}, have been widely adopted by
%system operators. These tools commonly include good
%software-engineering practices such as code reuse and composition in
%management and configuration scripts. It is nowadays possible to build
%a new installation by assembling different pieces of existing
%installations\footnote{\url{https://galaxy.ansible.com/}}\footnote{\url{https://forge.puppet.com/}}
%which improves the productivity of system operators and prevents many
%errors. Many distributed software commissioning are nowadays written
%with one the three above tools and by using containers between the
%host operating system and the pieces of software, such that
%portability of installations is improved. For instance, OpenStack,
%which is the de-facto open source operating system of Cloud
%infrastructures, can be automatically installed on clusters by using
%the
%\href{https://docs.openstack.org/kolla-ansible/latest/}{\emph{kolla-ansible}
%  project}, which uses both Docker containers and Ansible.
%
%Yet, even for such well-established software, there is still much room
%for improving the efficiency of the commissioning process (\ie
%reducing deployment times, minimizing services interruptions etc.).

As manually coding parallelism into commissioning procedures is
technically difficult and error prone, automated parallelism
techniques should be introduced.
