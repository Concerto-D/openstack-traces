\begin{itemize}
\item component-based commissioning model
\item control components to handle the commissioning of any existing
  component in any language
\item goals: programmable, composable, reusable, efficient
\item composed of:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item meta-model
  \item graphical language
  \item concrete language
  \item formal specification (next section)
  \item formal operational semantics (next section)
  \end{itemize}
\item meta-models of assembly and components (add groups)
\item example Apache/MariaDB with graphical and concrete syntax
\item simplified explanation of the operational semantics (middleware)
\item discussion on the goals
\end{itemize}
